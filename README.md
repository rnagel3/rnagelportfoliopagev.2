# rnagelportfoliopage

Hello,

Thank you for visiting my portfolio v.2 page!

In this version, I affix the header to the top of the page. No more "sticky" header. 

I also use a different algorithm for the JavaScript "smooth scroll" (app2.js). The algorithm creates an acceleration and deceleration effect that is quite pleasant. In my original, I found that that JavaScript algorithm (app.js) did not provide a "smooth" effect.

Also, the color scheme is not my favorite, but something has to be choosen. I am not super picky about the colors and fonts right now.
